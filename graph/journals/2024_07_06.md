- Publishing Logseq Graphs
	- References
		- [Official publishing documentation](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/publishing)
		  id:: 668a89f1-a2ed-4d89-add2-ca4f95bd3295
		- [Third-party guide using a VPS](https://discuss.logseq.com/t/how-to-publish-your-logseq-as-selfhosted-site/16412)
	- Summary
		- Both approaches are just different ways of using the "export graph as HTML" and uploading to a web server.
	- Confusions
		- Page-level configuration relies on the `public` page property, but the documentation also lists the `publish` property as being relevant.

		- I'll add some additional pages to understand the functionality:
			- [[debugging/exports]]
			- [[debugging/exports/pub{lic,ish}-00]]
			- [[debugging/exports/pub{lic,ish}-01]]
			- [[debugging/exports/pub{lic,ish}-10]]
			- [[debugging/exports/pub{lic,ish}-11]]
			- [[debugging/exports/pub{lic,ish}-xx]]
			- [[debugging/exports/pub{lic,ish}-x0]]
			- [[debugging/exports/pub{lic,ish}-x1]]
			- [[debugging/exports/pub{lic,ish}-0x]]
			- [[debugging/exports/pub{lic,ish}-1x]]

			- I'll try to use GitHub to sync and publish a blank graph, probably this one.
