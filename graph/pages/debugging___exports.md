public:: true

- ((66897b4e-2563-4cdf-88cd-98d1ce7b930a))
- I'm basically setting up a truth table for this, such that:
	- `x` means it should be the default value ("don't care")
	- `0` means false
	- `1` means true
	- the first digit is for `public` and the second digit is for `publish`
- Conclusion
	- The built-in "Export pages as HTML" button exclusively cares about the `public` property
